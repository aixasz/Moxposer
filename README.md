Moxposer is a diagnostic tool tailored to safeguard .NET applications against unintended or potentially harmful `HttpClient` usage patterns. If you're building applications with sensitive data and want to ensure data doesn't unknowingly leak to external sources via the `HttpClient` class, Moxposer is here to help!

## üåü Features

- **Deep Analysis:** Dive into the depths of your C# code to identify potential pitfalls in `HttpClient` usage.
- **Focused Detection:** Targets HTTP methods like `PostAsync`, `PutAsync`, and `PatchAsync` that transmit data.
- **Variable URL Warnings:** For variable URLs, receive alerts on potential data sent to unknown destinations.
- **CI/CD Ready:** Perfectly suited for CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated checks in continuous integration environments.
- **Whitelisting:** Option to exempt certain packages from the analyzer's scrutiny via custom whitelisting.
- **Comprehensive Tests:** Reliability is key! And that's why Moxposer comes with an extensive set of unit tests.

### Global Whitelist Configuration 

Open `appsettings.json` then added whitelist dll name to `GlobalWhitelists` property.  
   ```json
   {
      "GlobalWhitelists": [
         "Microsoft.*",
         "System.*"
      ]
   }
   ```

### specifying which whitelist packages to in `csproj`.

Extract package names from PackageReference tags under ItemGroup tags that have the attribute `DllAnalyzerWhitelist="true"`

example:
```xml
  <ItemGroup DllAnalyzerWhitelist="true">
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp" Version="4.7.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
